# This file is an example for getting the transition probability matrix

## Run
```
python trans_prob.py
```
"trans_prob_T.xlsx" and "trans_prob_W.xlsx" would be generated. 

"trans_prob_T.xlsx" is the transition probability matrix for "TRANSMIT" and "trans_prob_W.xlsx" is for "WAIT".

## A Case
Here is an example that ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?p_b=0.3,p_b'=0.4,p_s=0.7,p_s'=0.6,p_t=0.5,D=2).

"transmit.xlsx" is the transition probability matrix for "TRANSMIT" in this case and "wait.xlsx" is for "WAIT".
